# Graph-Aware Distillation (GradBERT)

Please download the pre-trained GradBERT node embeddings from this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tol67YewYOGUSF4T2qwrdS-hBHBg-iCX?usp=sharing and extract them in this folder. Please make sure that the extracted folder has this substrucutre `embeddings/ogbn-*/`.

Then, you can go `ogbn-arxiv` or `ogbn-products` folder and run the corresponding `sh` commands to reproduce GradBERT-MLP results.
